## 🧠 How to Build Logic in Programming

Mastering logic in programming isn’t just about memorizing syntax—it's about **thinking like a problem solver**. Here’s a practical, step-by-step approach to develop your logical thinking and problem-solving ability:

### 1. 🔄 **Understand the Data Flow**

Before writing any code, deeply understand how data is flowing:

* Trace how data **enters**, how it is **processed**, and what **output** is generated.
* Use a pen and paper or dry run code line by line.
* Ask yourself: *What are the values of each variable at every step?*

### 2. 🧑‍🏫 **Use the 90-10 Rule (Then 80-20, 70-30…)**

Start with the **90-10 learning method**:

* 90% from **guided examples or tutorials**, 10% your own effort.
* Then slowly shift to 80-20, 70-30, 60-40... until you're building on your own (10-90).

📝 *Pro Tip*: After every tutorial, try solving similar problems without help to reinforce the logic.

### 3. 📋 **Understand TODO Projects Thoroughly**

* Break down projects into small, manageable tasks (TODOs).
* Study **how each block or function contributes** to the full project.
* Never just copy—**analyze the logic** behind each step.

🧠 *Think like the programmer who originally wrote it.*

---

### 4. 💡 **Add Your Own Features (Added Value)**

* After completing a project, **don’t stop**—improve it!

  * Add small features like validation, sorting, filtering, or extra user input.
  * Even tiny changes help build independent thinking and real-world logic.

✨ *Creativity is the best way to strengthen logic.*

---

### 🌱 **Bonus Tips**

* Solve DSA and pattern-based problems regularly (start from easy).
* Write pseudo-code or draw a flowchart before jumping into real code.
* Use a debugger or print statements to track logic and errors.
* Participate in coding challenges (like LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.).
* Build mini-projects and keep experimenting.
